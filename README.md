# Learning about GLFW

Mostly just testing stuff. Might as well be a C program but whatever, for now I'll leave it as it is.

### Tutorial
Most of the code is based off of [these tutorials](https://learnopengl.com/)

### Libraries
[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) for window and context creation, input handling, and probably other things.  
[GL Math](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) for matrix manipulation  
[stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for image loading  
[GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) ... honestly i have no idea...  

--------------------------------
Maybe later I will organize the code <sup><sub>probably not</sub></sup>

_**THIS IS NOT AN OPENGL APP!!! JUST A BASIC TRIANGLE SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR RENDERING!!!**_
<sup><sub>yeah right<sub><sup>
